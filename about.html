        <strong><em>Yoga with Laura</em></strong> was launched in 2015 as an
        online Yoga teaching business. We have qualified teachers from all over
        the world who are here to guide you on your Yoga journey straight from
        the comfort of your own home. <strong><em>Our mission</em></strong> is
        to help people lead a more active lifestyle and to teach them how to
        nourish the mind, body and soul.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our classes are suitable for anyone who lacks the time to head to the
        gym or a studio or would just prefer to exercise from home. Whoever you
        are, we have the perfect workout for you!
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>Yoga with Laura</em></strong> currently has over 1,000 happy
        members who have joined the Yoga Community since the launch. We love
        helping as many people as we can by providing quality videos, online
        support and a variety of classes for all levels. So step onto your mat,
        enjoy your practice and don't worry, we've got your back!
