        <strong> <em>Yoga with Laura</em> </strong>was launched in 2018 as an
        online Yoga teaching business. Laura is a Birmingham based teacher with
        10 years experience. We have qualified teachers from all over the world
        who are here to guide you on your journey straight from the comfort of
        your own home. <strong>Our mission</strong> is to help people lead a
        more active lifestyle and to teach them how to nourish the mind, body
        and soul.
        <br />
        <br />We are suitable for anyone who lacks the time to head to a gym or
        a studio or would just prefer to exercise from home. We have over 1,000
        happy members who have joined our Yoga Community since we launched the
        online business. We love helping as many people as we can by providing
        quality Yoga videos, online support and a variety of classes for all
        levels.
