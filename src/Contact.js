          Our classes run Monday - Saturday and are 45 minutes long. In each
          class we focus on specific areas of the body to achieve strength,
          flexibility and balance. The cost is ¬£10 per session or ¬£30 for a
          monthly membership. Your first 2 taster Yoga classes will be{" "}
          <strong>FREE</strong>.<br /> <br />
          We encourage everyone to be logged in on Zoom at least 5 minutes prior
          to the scheduled time. We love receiving feedback from our community,
          therefore we have a dedicated 5-10 minute question time at the end of
          each class. All you need is your Yoga mat, a bottle of water, a
          cushion or towel for support and your smile!
